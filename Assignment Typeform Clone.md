# **Typeform Builder**

##  SDE Fullstack Assignment

# **Description**

Build a functional clone of the Typeform application that replicates Typeform's design, user experience, and core form-building and form-filling workflows.

The platform should allow a creator to build forms with multiple question types via a drag-and-drop-style builder, publish them via a shareable link, collect responses through the signature one-question-at-a-time conversational experience, and view submitted results, all within the clean, focused interface of the original Typeform app.

Your implementation should visually and functionally feel like a modern Typeform. The two hardest and most important pieces are the builder and the polished, animated one-question-at-a-time respondent flow.

**Note: Your application should match the original application in terms of UI and UX, look and feel should be exactly the same.**

# **AI Tools Usage**

You are allowed and encouraged to use AI tools such as ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, or any other AI assistant for development. Use AI as heavily as you like to move fast. However, you must understand every line of code you submit and be prepared to explain your implementation decisions during the evaluation interview.

# **Technical Stack**

* Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript)

* Backend: Python with FastAPI / Django

* Database: SQLite (design your own schema)

*Note: the respondent flow (public form fill) should be a real, shareable experience — no auth required to fill a published form.*

# **Core Features (Must Have)**

## **1\. Form Builder**

Recreate the Typeform builder.

* Create a form with a title and ordered list of questions

* Add, edit, reorder (drag-and-drop), and delete questions

* Question types: short text, long text, multiple choice, dropdown, email, number, yes/no, rating

* Per-question settings: required toggle, description/help text

* Live preview of the form

## **2\. Form Management (CRUD)**

* List of the creator's forms with status (draft/published) and response count

* Create, rename, duplicate, and delete forms

* Publish / unpublish, generating a shareable public link

* All form definitions must persist

## **3\. Respondent Flow (the Typeform experience)**

Implement the public form-filling experience.

* One question at a time, full-screen, with smooth transitions between questions

* Keyboard navigation (Enter/arrow to advance) and a progress indicator

* Client \+ server validation (required, email format, number, etc.)

* Submit stores the response; show a thank-you screen

* No login required to fill a published form

## **4\. Results / Responses**

* Per-form responses view (a table/list of submissions)

* View an individual response in full

* Basic summary stats per question (e.g. counts for choice questions)

* All responses must persist

## **5\. Typeform Experience**

The application should closely resemble the Typeform experience, including:

* The distinctive conversational, one-at-a-time fill UI with transitions

* Clean builder layout with live preview

* Forms, modals, and inline editing

* Notifications / toasts

* Settings placeholders (theme, thank-you screen)

The goal is to make the application feel like Typeform rather than a generic multi-field form.

# **Mocked / Placeholder Sections**

The following can be present as placeholders (a simple “Coming Soon” is sufficient):

* Advanced logic jumps / branching (basic branching is a bonus)

* Integrations / webhooks

* Team collaboration & sharing

* Payment/file-upload question types

* Real creator authentication may be simplified (assume a default logged-in creator)

# **Bonus (Optional)**

* Logic jumps / conditional branching

* Custom themes (colors, fonts, background)

* Export responses as CSV

* Partial-response tracking / completion rate

* File-upload question type

* Dark mode

# **Important Notes**

* UI Design: your application should totally resemble Typeform's design. Study Typeform's UI carefully before starting.

* Sample Data: seed your database. Seed a couple of published forms with mixed question types and some existing responses so the app is immediately usable.

* Database Design: design your own database schema. This will be evaluated.

* README File: include setup instructions, tech stack used, architecture overview, database schema, and any assumptions made.

* Original Work: plagiarism from existing repositories will result in immediate disqualification.

# **Deliverables**

* Source Code: a public GitHub repository containing frontend/ and backend/.

* Documentation: a README with setup instructions, architecture overview, database schema, and API overview.

* Demo: a hosted, working link.

# **Submission**

* Upload your code to GitHub and ensure the repository is public.

* Deploy your application (Vercel, Netlify, Render, Railway, or any cloud service).

* Submit both the GitHub repository link and the deployed application link.

# **Evaluation Criteria**

| Criteria | What We Look For |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Functionality** | All core features working correctly, including the builder and the one-question-at-a-time respondent flow |
| **UI/UX** | Visual similarity to the original app's design and UX patterns |
| **Database Design** | Well-structured schema with proper relationships |
| **Backend / API Design** | Clean, sensible API design and architecture |
| **Code Quality** | Clean, readable, and well-organized code |
| **Code Modularity** | Proper separation of concerns, reusable components |
| **Code Understanding** | Ability to explain your code during evaluation |

# **Timeline**

Estimated effort: approximately 24 hours of work.

Submission Deadline: as communicated alongside this assignment.

Good luck\!
